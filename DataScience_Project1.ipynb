The bottom 3, Delridge, Northgate, and Rainier Valley, brings in Northgate as a new contender, while Rainier Valley moves up even though it contains the average cheapest single neighborhood of Rainier Beach.

    "I got an r-squared value of ~0.4 for the training data and ~0.29 for the test data, indicating that there is a significant amount of variance between the data and a linear model. The highest coefficient was transit, indicating that this factor has the greatest effect on rating in this model, followed by top ranked amenities. This model cannot necessarily prove that there is a strong relationship between any of the variables tested and the rating of an AirBnB. I would further attempt to modify this calculation by perhaps taking out the amenities and handling some of the variables differently (imputing with mean instead of median). However, it doesn't hurt for Seattle homeowners to consider transit options when posting their listings as well as the amenities available in order to increase their ratings by chance."
